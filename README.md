  ## Description
  This is a command-line application powered by Node.JS and the Jest and Inquirer packages. This takes input on a manager, and employees; either engineers or interns, with different information for each. It then takes that input and populates cards for each employee on a website that is styled with BootStrap.


  ## Installation
  Clone the code from https://github.com/ericbwebdev86/org-chart-builder and run npm install to download the dependencies.
  

  ## Usage
  This app allows a manager to enter basic information and create an org chart on a simple, responsive website.
